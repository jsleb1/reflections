When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-- If the files are going to be shared with other people or if I need to access the files from a computer other than my own.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--- to keep them private until the code is ready to be viewed publicly.
